**Splice Junction Analysis - 2021 - Instituto Gulbenkian de CIència, Lisbon**

Back in 2021, after completing my Master’s, I had the great opportunity to work as a Research Assistant in [Pablo Sartori’s lab](https://www.sartorilab.org/) at the [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/). There, I collaborated closely with [Joe Howard, PhD](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/jonathon-howard/) and [Dr. Jingtao Lilue](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/lilue-jingtao/), both of whom impressed me daily with their intelligence and expertise.  

During my scholarship, I had the pleasure of updating and further developing a method for exploring entropy in alternative splicing in RNA-seq data, based on the work of [Österreich et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/048124v1.full). This project allowed me to deepen my skills in Bash and Python while leading my first major independent project. I also participated in statistics courses, seminars, and other training opportunities organized by the IGC. You can explore the results of this project in my [Github repository](https://github.com/claraFT/SpliceJunctionsAnalysis)

I strongly encourage recent graduates to pursue experiences such as Erasmus+ to broaden their horizons and gain valuable exposure to the “real world” after their formative years.
