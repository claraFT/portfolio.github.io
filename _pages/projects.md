**Splice Junction Analysis - 2021 - Instituto Gulbenkian de CIència, Lisbon**

Back in 2021, after finishing my Master's, I had the great opportunity of working as a Research Assistant in Pablo Sartori's lab (https://www.sartorilab.org/) group in the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciència (IGC). There I worked mostly with Joe Howard, PhD () and Dr Jingtao Lilue (), both of them surprised me everyday with their intelligence and experience. During the scholarship I had the pleasure of updating and further developing a method for exploring entropy in alternative splicing in RNA-seq data based on the work of Osterreich et al (). This allowed me to work with Bash and Python, developing my first big individual project, while also participating in Statistics lessons and other activities and course organized by the IGC. I strongly encourage all recent graduates to pursue an experience such as Erasmus+ to broaden their horizons and gain exposure to the ‘real world’ after their formative years. 

Back in 2021, after completing my Master’s, I had the great opportunity to work as a Research Assistant in [Pablo Sartori’s lab](https://www.sartorilab.org/) at the [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/). There, I collaborated closely with [Joe Howard, PhD](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/jonathon-howard/) and [Dr. Jingtao Lilue](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/lilue-jingtao/), both of whom impressed me daily with their intelligence and expertise.  

During my scholarship, I had the pleasure of updating and further developing a method for exploring entropy in alternative splicing in RNA-seq data, based on the work of [Österreich et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/048124v1.full). This project allowed me to deepen my skills in Bash and Python while leading my first major independent project. I also participated in statistics courses, seminars, and other training opportunities organized by the IGC. You can explore the results of this project in my [Github repository](https://github.com/claraFT/SpliceJunctionsAnalysis)

I strongly encourage recent graduates to pursue experiences such as Erasmus+ to broaden their horizons and gain valuable exposure to the “real world” after their formative years.
