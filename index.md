**Hello! I'm Clara.** 👋  
This is my personal page where I maintain an updated version of my CV, projects and miscellanea. 

🔬 **Background**  
I'm a Data Analyst with a background in Biochemistry (BSc) and Microbiology (MSc). 

💻 **Data Analyst**  
I analyze NGS, wet-lab, environmental, and clinical datasets using statistics, machine learning, and impactful plots and dashboards to uncover patterns, solve problems, and communicate findings clearly.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
`R` | `Python` | `SQL` | `MongoDB` | `Git` | `Bash`  
*Currently exploring*: `Deep Learning`, `PySpark`, and advancing my `Tableau` skills.  

🌱 **Beyond Data**  
I love literature 📚, crossfit 🏋️‍♀️ and yoga 🧘‍♀️. You’ll often find me exploring my city or nearby nature on long walks 🌿.
